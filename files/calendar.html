            Family Play Dates are held two or three times each semester on the playground from 3:15 p.m. – 5 p.m. Siblings and snacks are welcome. Play dates provide another opportunity to meet other families from the nursery school while your children play with their classmates.

              Open House is a time for our students to show family their indoor and outdoor learning spaces: the classrooms and playground. Open House is held for a few hours on a Saturday or Sunday in October. Families are encouraged to stop by at some point during the Open House event. This is also a great opportunity for families to meet other families within the school.

              Once each semester, the classrooms have a special celebration for families and friends. We invite dads and granddads in the fall and moms and grandmoms in the spring. Of course, any special friend is invited, and we are very flexible about who attends each semester. The children may prepare a special snack, perform a song or dance or simply enjoy time in their classroom with their special visitor. These events take place during the school day and last approximately one hour.

The spacious and well-built play space next to the pavilion keeps the children entertained. Teachers and staff especially love seeing our school’s alumni join their siblings at the picnics.
