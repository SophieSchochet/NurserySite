          An application fee of $40 is required when applying to the nursery
          school. After this is received, your child is placed on an enrollment
          list. You will be notified of acceptance in the March preceding the
          fall enrollment date. Upon acceptance, a nonrefundable deposit of one
          monthâ€™s tuition is due. This will be applied to tuition for the
          following May.
